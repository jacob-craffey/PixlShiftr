# PixlShiftr

The glitch effect is created by an algorithm that selects pixels at random, and shifts their RGBA value to their neighboring pixels.  
Move the shifter back and forth to watch your image melt into a glitched mess in real-time!

The sort algorithm is currently using bubble sort, which is inefficient and will be updated.  
**Do not use sort with images larger than 720p unless you are very patient.
